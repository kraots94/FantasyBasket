This project was developed in the context of the [International Summer School for Humans & Technologies](https://sites.google.com/view/humanstechnologies/home) at [Chemnitz University of Technology](https://www.tu-chemnitz.de/index.html.en).

It is a simple game with these mechanics:
* Immersive Virtual Reality
* Throw rocks in volcanos
* Different rock elements (Ice, Earth, Fire, Bolt) 
* Rocks spawn in front of the player
* Gain points when appropriate rock element is thrown to a volcano
* Simple UI showing the current points, combo counter and error counter
